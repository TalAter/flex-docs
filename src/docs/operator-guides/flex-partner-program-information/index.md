## Flex - a headless approach for building marketplaces

Flex offers a more efficient way to build marketplace platforms without
sacrificing quality or user experience. It offers a generic
[management console](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/background/concepts/#console)
and backend that work out of the box for any type of marketplace (in our
target segment of location and scheduling based service and rental
marketplaces), and don't require per-marketplace changes.

In addition,
[we provide templates](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/background/concepts/#flex-templates-for-web-ftw)
for the client side apps. These should be customized per customer, as
each marketplace business is unique, but we estimate that typically the
template covers 75% of a marketplace's needs out of the box.

If there are needs for custom backend functionality (a typical example
could be a third party payment gateway or an integration to marketplace
operator's own IT systems), these can be built as customization
projects.
[Our architecture](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/introduction/introducing-flex/)
makes it easy to integrate third party software.

## Flex Partner Program

The Partner Program is a network of experienced Flex developers.
Sharetribe connects suitable Flex leads to partners. Partners evaluate
the client’s project, propose a project, and launch the client’s
completed marketplace. Partners may continue developing for the client
after the first version of the marketplace is launched.

Sharetribe and its partners maintain a commercially independent
relationship. Partners establish relationships with referred or
self-sourced clients on their terms; rates and margins are determined by
the partner, without any claim from Sharetribe. Meanwhile, Sharetribe
does not share subscription revenues for projects built by our partners.

Such an arrangement allows us to share clients in good faith: we trust
our partners to recommend the best approach to the client, which may not
always be building with Flex.

## Steps to becoming a partner

- Launch a project into production
- Meet with Sharetribe
- Acceptance to Partner Program
- Establish lines of communication (Slack, marketing materials)
- Share with leads

The foremost requirement to becoming a Flex partner developer is to
launch a project into production. Afterwards, we will meet to learn more
about your experience and services that you offer. We may contact your
client to hear about their experience too. If we accept you into the
program, we will establish lines of communication in Slack. Our sales
team and you will use our channel to share information about leads and
projects. An engineer from Sharetribe will also join the channel to
provide technical perspectives and share more information about upcoming
releases, The sales team will then start referring interested clients to
your point of contact.

Your contact point during this process is Thomas Rocca. If you are
working on your first project and expect to launch soon, you should get
in touch with him at thomas.rocca@sharetribe.com to complete your
onboarding.
