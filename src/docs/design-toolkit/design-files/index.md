Saunatime Flex Template for Web (WTF) designs are available as Sketch files. The design files include complete designs for FTW desktop and mobile, as well as wireframes for FTW desktop. You can use these files as the basis for your own designs. This approach can dramatically speed up the design process, and it offers an easy starting point for the developers.

[Access design files in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/171T-lYUGJURrAF5qCtTZ0298WPhhG0SG?usp=sharing).
