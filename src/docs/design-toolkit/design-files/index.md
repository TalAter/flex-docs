published: true
---

Saunatime Flex Template for Web (WTF) designs are available as Sketch files. The design files include complete designs for FTW desktop and mobile, as well as wireframes for FTW desktop. You can use these files as the basis for your own designs. This approach can dramatically speed up the design process, and it offers an easy starting point for the developers.

[Access design files in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/171T-lYUGJURrAF5qCtTZ0298WPhhG0SG?usp=sharing).

The design files can be used according to [Creative Commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The files can also be opened with Adobe XD and Figma. The font used is Sofia Pro, which can be downloaded through [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/sofia).

We are glad to receive ideas and improvements at hello@sharetribe.com
