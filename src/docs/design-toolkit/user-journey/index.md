Building your custom marketplace starts with defining the user journey
through your marketplace; how providers and customers use your
marketplace illustrates the platform you’re building.

A user’s journey through a marketplace can be divided into three
distinct processes: Content creation; Content discovery; and Transaction
process. Content creation refers to the act of users—usually
providers—creating listings that customers use to request a product or
service. Content discovery concentrates on how customers find what they
need. Finally, the transaction process stipulates how a customer and
provider interact through a listing on the marketplace.

*Customer (buyer)* - A user who registers to a marketplace to make
purchases.
*Provider (seller)* - A user who sells or rents their products
or services on a marketplace.

[Flex Templates for Web](/background/concepts/#flex-templates-for-web-ftw)
are an efficient starting point for building your custom marketplace
with Flex. They are open-sourced website applications that developers
can modify per your unique requirements. The result is a custom-built
marketplace without the cost or time required to build it from scratch.

One Flex Template for Web option depicts Saunatime, a fictional,
Airbnb-style marketplace for renting saunas per day. To better
understand your Flex starting point and how to customize it, let’s look
at Saunatime’s content creation, content discovery, and transaction
journeys in detail.

## Discovery Journey

The discovery journey depicts how users search and find listings in your
marketplace. Starting on the landing page, users progressively narrow
their search to find the service, rental, or product they need. Users
might find what they need by searching nearby locations or via keywords.
Results should be filtered by relevant criteria, like price or category.

## Content Creation Journey

A marketplace is defined by its content: the types of users and listings
communicate what your marketplace is all about. Listings, in particular,
are crucial. They are the description of the product or service that a
provider offers on the marketplace and, ultimately, serve as the
initiation point for a transaction on your marketplace. Listings can
take many forms, such as the storefront of a service provider, an
experience itinerary, or a product page.

## Transaction process

The transaction process concerns the booking or buying event that
happens between the listing provider and the purchasing customer.
Sharetribe Flex lets you extensively customize the rules and steps of
your transaction process to govern how providers and customers
capitalize on your marketplace.

## Designing your marketplace’s user journey

As the development starting point, Saunatime’s user journeys are the
default ways in which users create content, discover listings, and
transact in Flex. Designing your marketplace’s journeys helps developers
understand how to modify the template code to build your custom
marketplace. The next article guides you in creating your own user
journey.
