A user journey map illustrates the step by step process that users take to complete a task. In this particular case, it answers the question "How do people use the marketplace?"

This article introduces you to the three main user journeys in the Flex Template for Web and prepares you to make your own. The Flex Template for Web is an efficient starting point for building your custom marketplace with Flex. Usually, developers download the open-sourced template, then modify its code to fit your requirements. The result is a custom-built marketplace without the cost or time required to build it from scratch.

Customizing the Flex Template for Web starts by specifying the custom features you’d like your marketplace to have. We recommend starting by defining the user journey through your marketplace; how providers and customers use your marketplace illustrates the platform you’re building

A user’s journey through a marketplace can be divided into three distinct processes: Content creation; Content discovery; and Transactions. Content creation refers to the act of users--usually providers--creating listings that customers use to request a product or service. Content discovery concentrates on how customers find what they need. Finally, the transaction process stipulates how a customer and provider interact through a listing on the marketplace.

Customer (buyer) - A user who registers to a marketplace to make purchases.
Provider (seller) - A user who sells or rents their products or services on a marketplace.

The Flex Template for Web depicts Saunatime, a fictional, Airbnb-style marketplace for renting saunas per night in Finland. To better understand your Flex starting point and how to customize it, let’s look at Saunatimes content creation, content discovery, and transaction journeys in detail.
