## What are we building?

In this tutorial, we start to customize FTW-daily template and turn it
into a cottage-rental marketplace called CottageDays.

The first part of this tutorial is about branding the template. However,
we will add new articles later about features that go beyond FTW-daily
template and its default behaviour.

**Part 1: Branding**<br /> Learn to make changes that are necessary to
turn Saunatime marketplace to CottageDays marketplace. At the end of
this part, we deploy CottageDays marketplace to Heroku.

## Prerequisites

FTW-daily is created on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/),
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/), and styles are creted with
[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). You should be
familiar with those libraries.

You should also have completed the
[Getting started guide](/introduction/getting-started-with-ftw-daily/)
and as a result, you have the FTW-daily repository cloned to your local
development environment and the app is available in
http://localhost:3000.

After that you could set up a Github repository for code changes. You
could either
_[Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository)
the FTW-daily repository_ or
_[create your own Github repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)_
and push your locally cloned Git repository there.

Even though the first option is easier (i.e. just click the "fork"
button in FTW-daily Github repo), the latter is the recommended approach
for the actual customization work. Here's a rough guide on how to set it
up:

1. Create a
   [Github repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo).

1. On the command line, check your remote repositories:

   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

   It should print this:

   ```shell
   origin  https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily.git (push)
   ```

1. Rename the FTW-daily repository (current '_origin_') as '_upstream_'

   ```shell
   git remote rename origin upstream
   ```

   <extrainfo title="Check what your remote repositories should print at this point">

   Check your remote repositories:

   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

   It should print this:

   ```shell
   upstream  https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily.git (fetch)
   upstream  https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily.git (push)
   ```

   </extrainfo>

1. Add your newly created repository as '_origin_':

   ```shell
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-account>/<the-name-of-your-new-repo>.git
   ```

   <extrainfo title="Check what your remote repositories should print at this point">

   Check your remote repositories:

   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

   It should print something like this:

   ```shell
   origin  https://github.com/<your-github-account>/<the-name-of-your-new-repo>.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/<your-github-account>/<the-name-of-your-new-repo>.git (push)
   upstream  https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily.git (fetch)
   upstream  https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily.git (push)
   ```

   </extrainfo>

1. Push an existing repository from the command line

   ```shell
   git push -u origin master
   ```

> **Note**: the examples above, used HTTPS remote URLs instead of SSH
> remote URLs.<br /> Read more about
> [remote URLs](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use).

Now you are ready to make code changes and save those to Github!
