# Sharetribe Brand Components

This is a directory of brand components supposed to be extracted and shared with
upcoming new projects.

In loose terms, this is a collection of
[styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/), configuration, and
baseline tooling.

## Guidelines

Some common guidelines for components. Applies also to components outside this
branded components collection.

### Use sanitize.css

### Don't inject global styles

### Component should not define outside margins

### Component height should be a multiple of the baseline

### Component should align with the baseline without adjustment

### Component should pass in extra props to the root component

### Export style as a static prop?
